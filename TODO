GOALS:

Instead of sending error message string back, send back error object
- https://github.com/dfahlander/typeson-registry/issues/10
Instead of ErrorEvent, send back error object to registerError
- maybe can make it an actual error object client-side, and apply all props to it

update README

changelog
- more detailed error objects (stack, etc)
- registerError gets error, not errorevent, for consistency and simplicity
- normalize differences in error handling caused by https://github.com/mknichel/javascript-errors/blob/master/README.md#dedicated-workers (don't rely on web worker sending error to host, use same manual mechanism used by shared workers)

create issue on promise-worker
- don't listen for error event in window, listen in worker and then send back (pull props out of error object and reassemble in host)
- needs message types

zuul
- test-local works, but test-browser hanging on saucelabs
  - try delete ngrok config
- switch to karma?
